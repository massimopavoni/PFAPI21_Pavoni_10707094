Repository for Algorithms and Data Structures exam final test.

The product of this project is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths (min-heap priority queues version).

The goal of the program is to output a ranking file that contains the best input graphs' indexes.<br>The metric to rank such graphs is defined as the sum of the shortest paths distance to all the reachable nodes starting from node 0: the smaller the sum, the better the graph.
